## Window Management
* Hammersoon - config file (init.lua) is in the <.hammerspoon> repo.
* Alt - Tab - provides apps specific and app-window specific tab switching

  ```
* Magnet - similar to Hammerspoon. Offers better control and less interferences than Hammersppon. Install Magnet from App Store (this is a paid app! it's worth the money)
